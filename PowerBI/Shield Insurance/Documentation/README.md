# Shield Insurance Dashboard Documentation

Welcome to the Shield Insurance Dashboard documentation! This guide will help you navigate and use the dashboard effectively, even if you're not technically inclined. I've included visual aids (GIFs) throughout to provide a clear understanding of each feature.

If you have any questions or feedback after going through this documentation, please don't hesitate to contact me. I am always happy to receive feedback and improve this guide to make the dashboard more accessible for everyone.

Let's get started!

## 1. Home Page Navigation

The home page serves as your central hub to access different sections of the dashboard:

- As you move your cursor over different headings next to icons, you'll notice they hover and move up slightly—this indicates you can click on them to navigate to that section
- Each section has a brief description below, helping you understand what information you'll find there
- You can click either the heading text or the icon itself to navigate to that page—both have the same functionality

## 2. Graph Switch Feature

The dashboard allows you to switch between different data visualizations:

- Look for the toggle switch between "Revenue" and "Customer"
- Select "Revenue" to view trend graphs showing revenue performance over time
- Select "Customer" to view customer growth trends over time
- Simply click on your preferred option to switch the graph display

## 3. Filter Button

To access filtering options:

- Look for the large "Filter" text button on the dashboard
- When you hover your cursor over this button, it will prompt you to "click to open"
- Clicking this button opens the filter panel where you can apply various filters:
  - Policy filters
  - City filters
  - Month filters
  - Age group filters
  - Sales mode filters

## 4. Using Filters

Filters help you narrow down the data displayed on the dashboard:

- Click on any filter and select the specific parameter you're interested in—the entire dashboard will update to show only data related to your selection
- You can apply filters from multiple categories at once (e.g., select "Mumbai" city and "30-40 years" age group)
- To select multiple options within the same filter (e.g., both Mumbai and Delhi):
  - Hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard
  - Click on each option you want to include
  - **Important Note**: If you don't hold the Ctrl key, selecting a new option will deselect your previous choice

## 5. Clear Filter Button

To reset all your applied filters at once:

- Look for the "Clear Filter" button at the end of the filter panel
- Click this button to remove all active filters
- The dashboard will return to its default view, showing all data

## 6. Multi-Cross Selection

You can filter the dashboard directly by clicking on items in tables:

- Click on any item in a table (e.g., a specific city) to dynamically filter the entire dashboard
- The dashboard will update to highlight information related to your selection
- To select multiple items for cross-filtering:
  - Hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard
  - Click on each item you want to include in your filter
- This cross-filtering functionality works with any table in the dashboard

## 7. Graph Filtering

Interact directly with graphs for more information:

- Click on any bar in a graph to cross-filter the dashboard and highlight related information
- Hover your cursor over a bar to see bit more detailed information about that specific data point
- This feature helps you quickly understand specific data points without needing to locate them in tables
