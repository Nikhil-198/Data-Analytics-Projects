# Shield Insurance Dashboard Documentation

Welcome to the Shield Insurance Dashboard documentation! This guide will help you navigate and use the dashboard effectively, even if you're not technically inclined. We've included visual aids (GIFs) throughout to provide a clear understanding of each feature.

If you have any questions or feedback after going through this documentation, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're always happy to receive feedback and improve this guide to make the dashboard more accessible for everyone.

Let's get started!

## 1. Home Page Navigation

The home page serves as your central hub to access different sections of the dashboard:

- As you move your cursor over different headings next to icons, you'll notice they hover and move up slightly—this indicates you can click on them to navigate to that section
- Each section has a brief description below, helping you understand what information you'll find there
- You can click either the heading text or the icon itself to navigate to that page—both have the same functionality

## 2. Graph Switch Feature

Filters help you narrow down the data displayed on the dashboard:

- Click on any filter and select the specific parameter you're interested in—the entire dashboard will update to show only data related to your selection
- You can apply filters from multiple categories at once (e.g., select "Mumbai" city and "30-40 years" age group)
- To select multiple options within the same filter (e.g., both Mumbai and Delhi):
  - Hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard
  - Click on each option you want to include
  - **Important Note**: If you don't hold the Ctrl key, selecting a new option will deselect your previous choice

## 5. Clear Filter Button

- To select multiple items for cross-filtering:
  - Hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard
